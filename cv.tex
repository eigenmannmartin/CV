This platform provides a large variety of physio therapeutic exercises for patients with Bechterew's disease
and aims to improve the health and mobility of the affected.
\smallskip

The initial release of the platform was planned within one month of the kick-off. We used
rapid prototyping to achieve fast iterations and bring all team members and stakeholders to the same level of knowledge. Because we used well known tools for development and hosting, costs and maintainability were optimized.

In Order to find and analyze causes of postoperative infection it was necessary to
build a web based mobile app to allow standardized auditing of any kind of workflow
before and during a surgery. Intensive requirement engineering beforehand,
extensive testing and analyzing user interactions with the app where required
to verify its applicability. The gathered data is then sent to external databases and BI tools for analysis and examination.
